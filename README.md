### To-Do List Web App
This mini To-Do List project uses core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and browser localStorage. Users can add, mark as complete, or delete tasks, with all data saved locally so it persists across page reloads. The project showcases how to manage dynamic content and application state entirely on the frontend using vanilla JavaScript.
